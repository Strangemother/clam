Spent most of today lost in one of those spirals where I keep asking myself if I’m doing enough, learning enough, becoming enough. Ridiculous pressure for a random Tuesday, but there it was. I tried to redirect that energy into something productive and sketched out a few ideas for future projects. They’re messy, but at least they exist. Later, while brushing my teeth, I suddenly had that floaty perspective shift — the one that whispers, “You’re a tiny creature on a spinning rock; relax.” Strangely comforting. The universe is very large, and my worries are very small. I think I’ll sleep okay.
