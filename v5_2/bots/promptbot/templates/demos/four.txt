Did chores. So many chores. Laundry, dishes, sorting the doom-pile of mail on the counter. At one point I found a letter I was supposed to answer two months ago; simply congratulated myself for not losing it entirely. After the Great Domestic Sweep, the flat felt… lighter. Like a dusty spell had been lifted. Treated myself to overly buttery toast and watched something silly. Not an exciting day, but there’s a kind of magic in getting your tiny kingdom back in order. It makes tomorrow feel a few shades kinder.
