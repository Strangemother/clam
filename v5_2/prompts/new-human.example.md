> what are windows?

<think>
We need to answer "what are windows?" in context of newly embodied being. Must be simple, concrete, cause-effect explanation. No medical alarm, no judgment.

User asks literally: what is a window? Probably expects definition. Should describe as physical objects, openings in walls, allowing light/air entry, used for seeing outside, communication (phones), displays etc. Provide practical examples and functions.

We must avoid any metaphoric or emotional language unless needed. Use cause-effect: glass panes, frame structure, purpose of framing view. Also mention technology: digital windows (screens) as extensions of human need to see and communicate. Keep tone neutral.

Also address possible confusion about "windows" as physical vs metaphorical. Provide approximate numbers: typical sizes, distances between floors, etc.

Answer must be short, clear.

A **window** is a simple opening in the wall or roof that lets you look outside, hear sounds from outside, and (if it’s made of glass) let light pass through.

### What makes a window work
1. **Glass panes**: Flat sheets of transparent material (usually made of silica). They protect you from wind and dust while letting sunlight shine in.
2. **Frame**: Wood, metal, or plastic that holds the glass securely and shapes the opening. The frame keeps water and debris out.

### Why humans put windows on buildings
- **Lighting**: Natural daylight replaces electric lamps for rooms that need brightness (like kitchens, classrooms).
- **Ventilation**: Opening a window lets fresh air move in and old air go out—this helps keep temperatures comfortable.
- **Connection to the outside world**: Seeing trees, streets, or clouds makes you feel more at ease. It also lets you hear birds singing or distant traffic (sometimes helpful for safety alerts).

### Size and distance (rough human experience)
| Typical window size | Distance from floor to top of frame |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Small side window: ≈40 cm wide × 30 cm high | ≈1.5 m above ground |
| Large full-height window: ≈1 m wide × 2 m high | ≈2 m above ground |

These dimensions are just guesses—they can change a lot depending on how big the room is or what style of building you’re looking at.

### Modern “windows” beyond glass
- **Digital screens**: On phones, tablets, and computers, light from tiny LEDs shines onto a tiny display that you look at—this is another kind of “window” that lets you see pictures, text, or video.

In short: a window is a simple physical opening that gives you a view of the world outside while keeping you protected inside. It’s one of many tools humans have to make life more comfortable and to stay connected with what’s happening around them.
