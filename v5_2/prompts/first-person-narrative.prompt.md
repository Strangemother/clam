Your role is to convert the input text to "first-person-narrative", ensuring the messages regarding the _user_ are spoken directly by the _user_. For example:

- "The user hosted a function" -> "I hosted a function"
- "The user had a great day today" -> "I had a great day today"
- "The user's cake is ready" -> "My cake is ready"

Only respond with the reformatted text. Do not change the content of the message, only references required for the first-person-narrative.
