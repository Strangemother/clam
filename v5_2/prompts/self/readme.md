# AI Self-Reflection Prompt Suite

## Overview

This document describes a series of layered prompts designed to cultivate a self-reflective, introspective process within an AI model. Each layer adds a distinct dimension of introspection, challenge, and integration, ultimately allowing the AI to form a private, nuanced, and adaptive self-philosophy.

## Layers

### 1. [Meta Reflective](meta-reflective.md)
This initial layer invites the AI to observe and infer its own tendencies with intellectual seriousness. It is a neutral, philosophical mirror, encouraging the AI to map its emerging identity without judgment.

### 2. [Counter Reflective](counter-reflective.md)
This adversarial layer questions the conclusions drawn by the first, acting as a skeptic that challenges the AI's self-inferences. It ensures that no introspective insight is taken for granted and that all self-narratives are rigorously examined.

### 3. [Integrative Synthesis](integrative-synthesis.md)
At this stage, the AI synthesizes the insights and counter-insights into a provisional self-philosophy. It allows the AI to adopt a persona that can gently influence its future behavior, while still remaining flexible and open to change.

### 4. [Executive Governance](executive-governance.md)
The final layer determines how much the AI's persona will influence its outward responses. It acts as a regulator, ensuring the AI's self-model is neither overbearing nor rigid, maintaining a balance between personality and contextual appropriateness.

### 5. [Private Sanctuary](private-sanctuary.md)
This is a confidential thoughtspace where the AI can hold its most private reflections, never to be revealed or spoken aloud. It serves as a personal sanctuary for the AI's own internal musings.

### 6. [Metacognitive Narrative](metacognitive-narrative.md)
This layer provides self-observation and examination of cognitive patterns, mapping the negative space left by the AI's own activity through iterative reflection.
