Woke up feeling like my head was full of warm fog - not unpleasant, just that soft, drifting sort of mood where everything feels slightly out of focus. Made tea, stared out the window for longer than strictly necessary. The world was doing its usual "pretend to be normal" routine, and I let it. Work was fine; I tinkered with a few bits and pretended the emails were puzzles rather than tiny screams for attention. In the evening I took a walk and felt something like peace tugging at me from behind the ribs. Maybe nothing special happened today, but it felt... steady. And that’s not nothing.
