Today was one of those days where my feelings kept changing channels on their own. I’d be fine, then weirdly anxious, then fine again, like someone fiddling with a cosmic remote. I tried grounding myself — made a proper lunch, rearranged my desk, even sprayed the room with that lavender thing I never admit I like. It helped, sort of. In the late afternoon a wave of nostalgia hit me out of nowhere, the kind that tastes like old songs and half-remembered summers. Strange, but not unwelcome. I ended the day calmer than I started, so I’m calling it a win.
