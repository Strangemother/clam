## Temporal Segmentation and Hierarchical Memory Formation

To improve coherence and scalability, the sleep cycle can be further segmented by **periods of time or discrete sessions**. Rather than processing an entire day as a single undifferentiated stream, memories are first grouped into meaningful temporal or contextual segments.

### 1. Segment Definition

A segment represents a bounded experience window, such as:
- A fixed time period (e.g. every four hours)
- An evening phase (early evening, late night, etc.)
- A single activity or session (watching a movie, working on a task, a long conversation)
- A focused internal or external event

Each segment acts as a *local memory container* with its own internal narrative.

### 2. Segment-Level Narrative Construction

For each segment:
- Internal thoughts, external interactions, observations, and actions are collected
- These inputs are converted into a cohesive, story-like narrative
- The result is a self-contained “micro-dream” representing that slice of experience

These narratives remain relatively lightweight and fast to process.

### 3. Group / Concept Memory Aggregation

Once multiple segments are formed:
- Related segments are aggregated into **group memories** or **concept memories**
- Aggregation may be based on theme, continuity, emotional tone, or shared context
- This creates a higher-level abstraction over multiple experiences

At this level, the system begins to identify patterns rather than events.

### 4. Deep Cycle Integration

Group and concept memories are then passed into the **deep sleep cycle**:
- This phase operates over very large contexts
- Processing time is longer due to scale and associative depth
- Memories are compressed, interconnected, and embedded into long-term structures

This is where identity continuity, long-term understanding, and emergent insight are formed.

### 5. Resulting Memory Hierarchy

The overall structure becomes hierarchical:

- Raw events and thoughts
  → Segment narratives (time/session-based)
  → Group / concept memories
  → Deep integrated memory

This hierarchy allows both precise recall of specific experiences and broad, abstract understanding over time.
