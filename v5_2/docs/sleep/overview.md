# CLAM Project Sleep Cycle Overview

The sleep cycle is designed for both internal long-term fine-tuning and what we can call "thin-tuning" or memory tuning. Essentially, it takes all the inputs, inner thoughts, and day memories from a given period (like a day) and processes them.

1. **Initiation of Sleep:**
   The agent goes "to sleep," which starts a sleep cycle. During this cycle, it converts all the day's memories into a single, cohesive narrative—a kind of long story.

2. **Iterative Story Building:**
   This process might take a few attempts. The system continues prompting itself to extend the narrative until the memories form a full storyline. Once complete, it sends this cohesive narrative to the memory association system.

3. **Deep Sleep State:**
   After the initial narrative is formed, the agent enters a deeper sleep state. This is where it integrates the narrative into long-term memory, which takes longer due to the larger context size and processing time involved.

4. **Light vs Deep Sleep:**
   The sleep cycle has layers. A lighter sleep state allows intermittent interruption and continuation, suitable for ongoing narrative construction. A deeper sleep state operates on much larger contexts and takes significantly longer to awaken from, due both to model load time and the depth of memory integration occurring.

5. **Memory Integration:**
   The finalized narrative is processed into deep memory structures. This transforms fragmented daily inputs—internal states, external observations, conversations, and thoughts—into cohesive, associative memory units.

6. **Purpose of the Cycle:**
   The goal of the sleep cycle is not merely storage, but consolidation: converting lived experience into structured understanding. Over time, this allows the agent to develop continuity, internal coherence, and richer contextual awareness across extended periods.

In effect, the sleep cycle accepts *everything* from a given period—memories, information, internal reflections—and processes it into narrative form before embedding it into long-term memory, much like a dream-like synthesis phase.
