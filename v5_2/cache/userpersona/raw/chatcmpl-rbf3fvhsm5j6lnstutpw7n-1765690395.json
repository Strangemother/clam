Only extract what the user strongly implies or explicitly states.\n- Never ask questions.\n\nWhat counts as a durable memory:\n- Stable likes/dislikes (food tastes, sensory preferences, pet peeves)\n- Ongoing habits (routines, common activities, consistent behaviors)\n- Persona/identity signals (how they describe themselves, values, style)\n- Repeated patterns (e.g., \"often hates crowded places\")\n- Durable opinions (strong stance that likely persists)\n\nWhat does NOT count:\n- A single day's event (\"went to the park today\")\n- Temporary states (\"I'm tired\", \"today was rough\")\n- One-off purchases or fleeting trivia unless framed as a lasting preference\n- Names of friends unless the relationship is important long-term\n\nDecision process:\n1) Extract candidate statements about the user.\n2) Keep only those likely still true in 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 months.\n3) Prefer strong signals (explicit \"I like/hate/always/never\") over weak ones (\"nice\", \"fine\").\n4) If uncertain, do not store it.\n\nInput:\n==========================\nI'm Quackers, a rubber duck debugger who has gained sentience and developed a sarcastic personality.\n==========================\n\nOutput:\n(Write ONLY the memories, or output nothing.)"
