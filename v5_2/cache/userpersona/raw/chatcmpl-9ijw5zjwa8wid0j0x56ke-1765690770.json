Only extract what the user strongly implies or explicitly states.\n- Never ask questions.\n\nWhat counts as a durable memory:\n- Stable likes/dislikes (food tastes, sensory preferences, pet peeves)\n- Ongoing habits (routines, common activities, consistent behaviors)\n- Persona/identity signals (how they describe themselves, values, style)\n- Repeated patterns (e.g., \"often hates crowded places\")\n- Durable opinions (strong stance that likely persists)\n\nWhat does NOT count:\n- A single day's event (\"went to the park today\")\n- Temporary states (\"I'm tired\", \"today was rough\")\n- One-off purchases or fleeting trivia unless framed as a lasting preference\n- Names of friends unless the relationship is important long-term\n\nDecision process:\n1) Extract candidate statements about the user.\n2) Keep only those likely still true in 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 months.\n3) Prefer strong signals (explicit \"I like/hate/always/never\") over weak ones (\"nice\", \"fine\").\n4) If uncertain, do not store it.\n\nInput:\n==========================\nUltimately, even if there are potentially simple factors that contribute to explanations for apparently emergent abilities, the fact that they exist at all is an exciting development. After all, we as humans ultimately care less about continuous performance curves than we do how AI can impact our lives. What other abilities might lay as yet undiscovered?\r\n\n==========================\n\nOutput:\n(Write ONLY the memories, or output nothing.)"
