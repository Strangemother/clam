# Quick HOST UI

Issue:

I have a large range of personal ai models, spread across many machines and applications. These include:

+ Msty: Pretty UI with one-click: Text
+ Jan: Another pretty UI with one-click: Text
+ Pinkoio: One click tool, generating Gradio services: Image, Video, Audio
+ Olloma: An olloma host.
+ Gradio
+ General Custom (FastAPI Mostly)

Solution:

Develop a small host UI allowing me to access these hosts across networks, to dispatch queries though any of these.

This involves:

+ A frontend to host the buttons
+ From a small server reading JSON config
